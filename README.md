# Linear Fractional Transformation
It is a project made for AESC students.
Linear Fractional Transformation - transformation of the form f(z) = (az + b) / (cz + d)

Suppose we have composition P*R*P^(-1), where P - stereographic projection, R - rotation of sphere. This transformation keeps a set of common circles (circles and straigt lines) so it should be an LFT.
Given programm shows and image of polar coordinate lines under this transformations F.
F is defined by an axis of rotation (1, 0, 0) or (1, 1, 0) or (1, -1, 0) and angle.
